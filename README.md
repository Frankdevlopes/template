Sign-In Page with Loading Animation
This project demonstrates a simple web application that features a sign-in page preceded by a loading animation. Upon completing the loading phase, the application transitions to a sign-in form displayed against a custom background image.

Features
Loading Animation: A visual indication that content is being loaded, displayed against a black background.
Dynamic Background Transition: After the loading animation concludes, the background smoothly transitions from black to a specified image, creating an engaging user experience.
Sign-In Form: A user interface element where individuals can enter their sign-in credentials, which becomes visible only after the loading phase.
How It Works
Structure
index.html: Contains the markup for the loading animation and the sign-in form.
style.css: Defines the styles for the loading animation, the sign-in form, and the dynamic background transition.
script.js: Contains the JavaScript logic to control the timing of the loading animation, the background transition, and the display of the sign-in form.
Implementation
Initial Page Load: When the page loads, the user sees a loading animation on a black background, signifying that the content is being prepared.

JavaScript Timing: After a predefined delay, simulated as the loading time, the script hides the loading animation.

Background Transition: Subsequently, the script changes the page's background from black to a specified image, enhancing the visual appeal.

Display Sign-In Form: Finally, the sign-in form is made visible against the new background, ready for user interaction.
